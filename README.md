hey viewers,

i just started learning node.js, express.js and other stuff which is used to make backend of website.

i made project called 'nationalist'. what are the special places, politics, states and other good things in India. I used Bootstrap to speed up the fronted page.
I didn't add all the statesdatas and other stuff just added some things that make my node and express.js concepts clear.

thank you
